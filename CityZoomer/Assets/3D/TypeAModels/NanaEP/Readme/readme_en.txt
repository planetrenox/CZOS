--------------------------------------------------
It is a model that is produced assuming use of TypeA AnimeShader in VRChat.

Since VRChat's polygon number limit was raised from 20,000 to 70,000, I made remake of anime-style Nana and finished it in illustration tones.

Please use shaders that are equivalent to TypeA AnimeShader.

Because it is MecanimHumanoid compatible, it can be used for applications other than VRChat.

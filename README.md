Download Unity Version [2020.3.30f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) & simply open the directory named CityZoomer.

Ignore the errors after import, this only happens during first import. 

Next open the scene named Level1. From here you can enter playmode as long as Steam isn't offline.

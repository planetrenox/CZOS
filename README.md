###### Unity Version [2020.3.30f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)



git LFS may not download large files if downloaded from the browser, so please git clone from commandline instead.

   - ```git clone https://github.com/PlanetRenox/CZOS.git```


###### Ignore the errors after import, open scene Level1 & you can enter playmode as long as Steam isn't offline.

if you have questions during the setup, send an email to cityzoomer@protonmail.com
